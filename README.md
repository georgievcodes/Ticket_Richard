# Telerik UI ASP.NET Core - Demo

## Description

This project is demo displaying some functionalities of the Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core. The info is displayed in the grid Layout using a Grid component that has several built in functions like pagination and sorting. The data in the grid is filterable using external drop down list component.

## Components

### DataSource

The project utilize a custom `DataSource<OrderViewModel>()` that binds data from the `GridController` to a component and makes it available for all other components on the page.

**Example:**

```
@(Html.Kendo().DataSource<OrderViewModel>()
        .Name("myDataSource")
        .Ajax(dataSource => dataSource
          .Read(read => read.Action("Orders_Read", "Grid"))
        )
)
```

- `Name()` configuration method sets a name of the `DataSource`. This is mandatory as its value is used for element ID attribute.
- `Ajax()` method is used to enable Ajax functionality.
- `PageSize()` method sets up the items shown per page.
- `Read()` method is used to set the end point in this case we use it to specify an action and a controller to be called.

### Grid

The Grid is a powerful component displaying data in a tabular format. It provides options for grouping, sorting, pagind, filtering and more.

**Example:**

```
@(Html.Kendo().Grid<OrderViewModel>()
    .Name("grid")
    .Columns(columns =>
    {
        columns.Bound(p => p.OrderID).Filterable(false);
        columns.Bound(p => p.Freight);
        columns.Bound(p => p.OrderDate).Format("{0:MM/dd/yyyy}");
        columns.Bound(p => p.ShipName);
        columns.Bound(p => p.ShipCity);
    })
    .Pageable()
    .ColumnMenu()
    .Selectable(selectable => selectable
    .Mode(GridSelectionMode.Single)
    .Type(GridSelectionType.Row))
    .HtmlAttributes(new { style = "height:550px;" })
    .DataSource("myDataSource")
    )
```

- `Name()` sets a name for the Grid. This is mandatory as its value is used for element ID attribute.
- `Pageable()` method allows for data to be displayed in pages in the grid.  
  `PageSizes(new[] {int, int, int }` an extra option can be used to allow the user to pick a different amount of items per page.
- `Selectable()` method allows for control over grid
  selection supporting  
  `Mode()` allows for single and multi selection options.  
  `Type()` allows for rows or cells selection.
- `ColumnMenu()` method enables a selection menu which allows the changing of column visibility.
- `DataSource()` method is used to configure the data source of the grid. Since the data source is already set in its own component we can simly add its `Name()` value to the `DataSource()` directly.

### DropDownList

We use a `DropDownList()` component to filter the data in the Grid component externaly. In this case the DropDownList is dinamically updated with distinct values from the `ShipCity` property of the `OrderViewModel` collection.

**Example**

```
@(Html.Kendo().DropDownList()
    .Name("dropDownList")
    .DataSource(dataSource => dataSource
    .Read(read => read
    .Action("DropDownListData", "Grid")))
    .SelectedIndex(0)
    .HtmlAttributes(new { style = "width:200px;" })
    .OptionLabel("Show All")
    .Events(e => e.Change("onChange"))
    )
```

- As every other component we set the `Name()` of the DropDownList.
- `DataSource()` gets the data for the list from the Grid controller
- `SelectIndex()` used to set selected item index.
- `OptionLabel()` used to set up a placeholder item.
- `Events()` used to set up different events.  
  In this instance we use the `onChange(e)` event to trigger an event when an option is selected from the list.
- `Read()` method calls the `DropDownListData` action of the `Grid` controller where we set a list of distinked `ShipCity` values in order to provide dynamic filtering options for the `Grid` component.

### Scripts

In order to take advantage of set `Events()` in components we utilize jquery and JS scripts to read the event and perform an action depending on it.

**Example:**

```
function onChange(e) {
    var dataItem = this.dataItem(e.item);
    if (dataItem == "Show All") {
        dataItem = "";
    }
    $("#grid").data("kendoGrid").dataSource.filter({ field: "ShipCity", operator: "contains", value: dataItem });
    return;
}
```

Selecting an option in the `DropDownList` triggers its `onChange()` event.  
We use the function with the same name `onChange(e)` to catch the event and use the selected option value as a filter option for the `Grid` data.  
We apply the filter option using `JQuery` filter function on the `DataSource` of the `Grid`.  
Special case is added to take care of the `Show All` default option of the list, setting the `dateItem` value to an empty string remove the filtration from the `Grid` data.
